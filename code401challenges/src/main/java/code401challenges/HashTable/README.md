# Hash Tables
Hash Table Implementation

## Features
- add(): takes in both the key and value. This method will hash the key (using a helper method), and add the key and value pair to the table. If there is a collision, the new key/value pair will be added as a linked list node
- get(): takes in the key and returns the value from the table
- contains(): takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already
- hash(): takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection
