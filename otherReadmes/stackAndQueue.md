# Stacks and Queues
Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Challenge
Within a `stacksandqueues` package, create the following classes: 
- A Node class: has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
- A Stack class that has a `top` property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Create a Queue class that has a `front` property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
