# Code Challenge 06: Linked list insertions

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k from the end of the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Keep track of a current node and a node that is K number of spaces back from the current node
- Walk through the linked list until you find the end, then return the value of the node that is K number of spaces back
